_**Minimal CSS framework for semantic HTML**_

-----

**nanoCSS** is a minimal CSS framework forked from [Pico CSS][1] that
prioritises semantics-oriented syntax. For the most part, nanoCSS works
the same as Pico CSS does, but with a different symbol prefix (`nano`
instead of `pico`) and a colouring provision that tracks the 8-colour
palette of IBM-PC compatible terminal consoles.

nanoCSS was forked from the v2.1.1 point release of its parent project.
Since it is a hard fork, its inaugural version is v1.0.0.

For now, follow the [Pico CSS][2] documentation to get started with
nanoCSS.

-----

A lot of the webdev-style infrastructure has been gutted due to lack of
necessity. As sure as you probably want to use plain CSS in your project
we also wish to employ the same philosophy.
